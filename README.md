# CsharpAuthorList


Summary:

This program reads personal information for multiple authors from a file and categorizes this info into a dialog box list with columns for different fields. The program can also spawn other dialog boxes to add new authors to the list or edit an existing author, and sort the list by field.

When using this program, click the column header for any field to sort the list by that field in an ascending order. Click it again to sort the list by that field in a descending order. Click the Add Author button to add a new author to the list. Click any of the rows in the list to edit the information in that row. Click the exit button to close the program.
